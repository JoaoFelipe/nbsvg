# NBSVG

Tool for converting Jupyter Notebooks to SVG.

## Disclaimer

This tool is not complete in any means. I made it to create images for a document having more control than using nbconvert with templates. The only features it supports are the ones I needed. I may or may not extend it in the future to support more features. Feel free to contribute with this project and even take it over. 

## Installation

To install nbsvg:

```
$ pip install nbsvg
```

nbsvg uses [imgkit](https://github.com/jarrekk/imgkit) for exporting HTML outputs as images. Hence you may need to install [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) as well.

## Usage
